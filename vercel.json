{
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "/(.*)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
            "value": "*"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  This will add the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to all responses from the Vercel server.

  i dont have file named vercel.json
  If you don't have a vercel.json file, you can create one in the root directory of your project.
  
  Here's an example vercel.json file that allows CORS from all origins:
  
  json
  Copy code
  {
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "/(.*)",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
            "value": "*"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  You can modify this file to match your specific requirements.
